# What is Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system. Initially conceived by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as the Linux kernel, the platform’s original core has since evolved into its current iterations thanks to global collaboration between thousands of developers and web programmers.

Linux manages every aspect of your computing experience, overseeing its hardware and allocating resources to ensure everything runs smoothly. It also affords multiple desktop environments, meaning you can customize your computer’s look and feel to your personal preferences.

## Important Characteristics:
- **Open-source** – the source code is available to everyone
- **Multi-user** – many users can use the system at once
- **Secure and stable** – widely used in servers and cybersecurity


## The Linux operating system is comprised of the following components:

1. **Bootloader:** The software that manages the boot process of your computer.
2. **Kernel:** The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.
3. **Init system:** A sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons.
4. **Daemons:** Background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.
5. **General server:** The sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server
6. **Desktop enviroment:** The piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from. Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).
7. **Applications:** Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be easily found and installed.
